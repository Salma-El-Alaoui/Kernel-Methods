# Kernel-Methods
Project for the course Kernel Methods for Machine Learning

# How to reproduce our result
Just run the file start.py, in the src folder. 
It will compute the HOG features, perform a Kernel PCA and a SVM (with Kernel),
with the parameters that were selected with cross validation (cf. main.py for further details).
